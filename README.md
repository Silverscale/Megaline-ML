# Tripleten-ML-Megaline
This is a project made for Tripleten's course "Introduction into machine learning". The prompt is as follows: Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra.
